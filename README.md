# CSI-Jupyter
Jupyter notebooks for CSI software

Some simple Jupyter notebooks for using the Classic Source Inversion (CSI) software, which has a version at https://github.com/jolivetr/csi

These examples are for a basic slip inversion on the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake in California, using interferograms available online at the Harvard Dataverse.

The Jupyter notebooks should be run starting with the covarSAR-A2D166.ipynb, then the downsampleSAR-A2D166.ipynb, and finally the slipInversion-A2D166.ipynb 

The notebooks have also been exported to Python scripts that can be run on the command line.
